                <td><b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</b> (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.<br>While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy,astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology.<br>Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.
                    Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near,Vinci,he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio.<br>He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan.<br>Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students.<br>Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration.
                    Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualised flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime.</td>

        <h1 align="center">Who was he?</h1>
        <p><b>Leonardo da Vinci</b>, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci son of <b>ser Piero from Vinci</b> was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence. He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci. Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina – who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one'. Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori – having been betrothed to her the previous year – and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages. From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings who were much younger than he born when Leonardo was 46 years old and with whom he had very little contact.</p>

            <summary>About his personal life</summary>
            <p>Leonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance, including mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book <i style="color: rgb(135, 113, 97);"><b>Divina proportione</b></i> in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with <b>Cecilia Gallerani</b> and the two Este sisters, <b>Beatrice and Isabella</b>. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.</p>
